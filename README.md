# Movie Recommendation

The Movie Recommendation System is designed to provide users with movie review and recommendation service, which will be developed and deployed on AWS Cloud platform. In detail, this application will automatically analyze each userâ€™s preferences and then recommend them with specific movies they may like, according to the rating, reviews and other information each person provided. The basic movie information will be extracted from MovieLens as well as IMDB and delivered to AWS for calculation.
